Patches XBOX360 isos to match Redump.org entries

This little python script basically does the same thing as "Xbox 360 Redump Patcher" by Starshadow.
The main difference is that it does not rely on external tools and also checks for overdump/underdump of the iso and trims/pads the file accordingly.
